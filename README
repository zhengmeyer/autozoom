Introduction
==============

The autozoom program is written in Python. It reads the VEX file, calculate the optimal ZoomFreqs among all stations, and write the calculated ZoomFreqs to the v2d file.

Requirements
==============

This program uses the VEX parser within the SFXC software developed at JIVE (http://www.jive.nl/jivewiki/doku.php?id=sfxc). Since the VEX parser doesn't support Python 3 yet, please use Python 2.x.
