Introduction
=================

The autozoom program is written in Python. It reads the VEX file, calculate the optimal ZoomFreqs among all stations, and write the calculated ZoomFreqs to the v2d file.

Requirements
=================

This program uses the VEX parser within the SFXC software developed at JIVE (http://www.jive.nl/jivewiki/doku.php?id=sfxc), the source code of which has been included in autozoom package under the vex directory. The program is tested using python2.7.

Installation
=================
The VEX parser uses Python Lex-Yacc. If it is not already installed, download and install it (use python2.x):
$ wget http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply-3.7.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf ply-3.7.tar.gz
$ cd ply-3.7
$ python setup.py install

To install the VEX parser (use python2.x):
$ cd vex
$ python setup.py install


Assumptions
=================

The program is developed based on the following assumptions:

1. ALMA uses the normal configuration, i.e. ALMA's channels are overlapped: the band centers are 62.5 * 15/16 = 58.59375 MHz apart. 

2. ALL other VLBI stations have the same frequency coverage (max. 2048 MHz). The bandwidth of all VLBI stations (except ALMA) is 2^N.

How does it work
=================

To use it:
$ python autozoom.py vex.file.name scan name.v2d case

The program will generate a name.scan.v2d file, which contains the calculated optimum zoom frequencies for each antenna.

Two cases are supported at the moment. To add your own case, edit the cases.py file.
