Introduction
=================

The autozoom program is written in Python. It reads the VEX file, calculate the optimal ZoomFreqs among all stations, and write the calculated ZoomFreqs to the v2d file.

Requirements
=================

This program uses the VEX parser within the SFXC software developed at JIVE (http://www.jive.nl/jivewiki/doku.php?id=sfxc). Since the VEX parser doesn't support Python 3 yet, please use Python 2.x.

Assumptions
=================

The program is developed based on the following assumptions:

1. ALMA uses the normal configuration, i.e. ALMA's channels are overlapped: the band centers are 62.5 * 15/16 = 58.59375 MHz apart, the total frequency coverage is about 1.9 GHz.

2. ALL other VLBI stations have the same frequency coverage 2048 MHz. The bandwidth of all other VLBI stations is 2^N, with a minimum bandwidth of 64 MHz.

How does it work
=================

To use it:
$ python autozoom.py vexfile scan name.v2d

The program will generate a name.scan.v2d file, which contains the calculated optimum zoom frequencies for each antenna.
